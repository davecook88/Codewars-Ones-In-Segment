# Codewars-Ones-In-Segment
My solution for a particularly challenging Codewars problem

The problem involved finding all of the 1s that appear in the binary representations of all numbers in a segment.

For example:

5 101
6 110
7 111
8 1000
9 1001

If 5 and 9 are entered, the answer returned should be 10, because there are 10 1s in the sequence shown above.
